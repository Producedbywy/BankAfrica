# Project Development Plan for Banking App

## Phase 1: Frontend Completion and Polishing
- Finalize and polish frontend UI/UX for core features:
  - Login, registration, and authentication flows
  - Dashboard with multi-currency balance, quick actions, transaction list
  - Mobile Money services (send, top-up, withdraw, pay bills, virtual card, QR pay)
  - Responsive design and accessibility improvements
  - Basic notifications and alerts UI (without backend integration)
  - Improve text readability and background colors (pending final fixes)

## Phase 2: Backend Integration and Core Services
- Implement backend APIs and services:
  - User management, authentication, and authorization
  - Transaction processing and history
  - Account management and multi-currency support
  - Notifications and alerts backend
  - Budgeting and spending insights
  - Security features (2FA, biometric login)
  - Integration with payment gateways and PSP partners (initial)
  - Webhooks and real-time updates

## Phase 3: PSP Partners and Advanced Features
- Integrate with PSP partners for payment processing
- Add advanced features:
  - Personalized offers and rewards
  - Chat support and help center
  - Enhanced analytics and reporting
  - Additional payment methods and wallets
  - Compliance and regulatory features

This phased approach allows us to build a solid frontend foundation first, then integrate backend services, and finally add advanced payment and user engagement features.

Please review and let me know if you want to adjust or add anything.
